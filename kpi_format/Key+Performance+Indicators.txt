5_555-KPI-230	Round-trip audio latency of the IVI device	"On top of the IVI device, someone will most likely implement Apple CarPlay (Windriver, the T1, ...). Apple places latency requirements on a CarPlay setup. In order for the IVI not to block our customer from implementing CarPlay, the IVI must adhere to certain latency requirements. This is what this KPI measures.

Measurement is to be done of the IVI audio round-trip latency, i.e., connecting a microphone to the IVI, playing a sound for that microphone, and measuring how long it takes to be played back through the internal speaker connection (no eAVB for now).

FYI: The CarPlay round-trip latency requirement it 275ms for wired connections, 415ms for wireless, with a goal of 200ms for both."
